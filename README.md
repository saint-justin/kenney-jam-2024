## Setup
This game is build using Godot Engine .NET 4.2.2. Download it from the [Godot Engine downloads page](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/).

Follow the [Godot with C# tutorial setup](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html) as well. You'll need to install the latest .NET version to run it. 

### Opening the Project in Godot
Open the Godot Launcher, select `Import`, then open where you pulled the repo and select `project.godot` then `Import & Edit`.

### Connecting VS Code
Open up the project in Godot `Dotnet -> Editor -> External Editor` and select VS Code. Once you have that done, also install the [VS Code C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) as well as the [VS Code Godot Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools).
